The Motley Fool will not disclose any personally identifiable information about individual users, except as described in this Privacy Statement. With the few exceptions that we explain here, we do not give, rent, lend, or sell individual information to our advertisers, although we do provide aggregate information. For example, we might tell an advertiser that there are 120,000 Registered Fools in Gotham City, but we will not tell them that Batman is one of them, nor will we tell them that his email address is bruce@statelywaynemanor.com. We may also use this aggregated information to help the advertisers reach the kind of audience they want. They may give us an ad and tell us the type of audience they want to reach (for example, males in the 22314 ZIP code). The Motley Fool (or people working on our behalf, under contracts and confidentiality agreements) would then take the ad and display it to users who have told us they meet those criteria. We may also disclose aggregate information (for example, information showing that 35 million of our readers clicked on a particular Web advertising banner last month) in order to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes.  As for individually identifiable information, we may disclose it only under the following circumstances:      We may disclose information to others when we have your consent.   If you sign up for a special offer from an advertiser (for example, in our ""What Every Fool Needs"" or ""Special Offers"" areas, or whatever we call them if we change their names), we will provide your individual contact information (for example, name, mailing address, email address, and/or telephone number), so that the advertiser or its agent can fulfill the special offer. Once the advertiser receives the information, it will handle the information under its own privacy policies. Obviously, if you do not want a particular advertiser to have your personal information, then you should not sign up for that advertiser's offer.   If you sign up for a service that relies upon third parties for important elements, we will provide your personal information to the third parties so that they can provide you with their services, and those companies will treat the data under their own policies. We will tell you about these service providers at the time you sign up for the service.   We may disclose information to selected partners, under nondisclosure agreements, only for the purpose of marketing Motley Fool co-branded offerings (such as a Motley Fool newsletter published by another company, a Motley Fool-branded credit card, Motley Fool cereal, or Motley Fool meringues-by-mail baked and delivered with love by <a href=""http://www.fool.com/specials/1999/emeringue/"">eMeringue</a>). Those partners will be able to use the personal information they receive from us only for marketing the co-branded offerings, not for marketing anything else. So, you might get a notice about Motley Fool Morsels, manufactured by Nature's Miracle cereal company, but you will not receive one for that company's other flakes, crisps, or nuggets. Of course, if you then sign up for a co-branded product from our partner, the information you provide to that company will be subject to the partner's own privacy policies. If you would prefer not to hear about such products and services, simply go to our <a href=""http://www.fool.com/community/nevermail.htm"">opt-out page</a> and let us know.   If you provide us with a ""snail mail"" address after May 15, 2005, we may provide that information to advertisers so that they can send you mail about their own products and services. If you do not want such mail, you can throw it in the trash, use it for kindling, or go to the <a href=""http://www.fool.com/community/nevermail.htm"">opt-out page</a>. Note: This provision does not apply to information received by us before May 15, 2005.   If you buy something from us, we will disclose your personal information to the extent necessary to fulfill your order and charge your credit card (if applicable). We may use a fulfillment company to fill and ship your order (excluding products you download directly from our site) and a credit card processing company to verify your card number and process the transaction. For example, if you order a ""Fool"" cap with your credit card, we need to give your address to the fulfillment house (so that it can ship the cap to you) and your credit card information to the processing company (to confirm payment). We may also give your information to a delivery or postal service so that it can get your order to you.   If you use our recommendation service to email one of our articles to a friend, The Motley Fool will automatically send this person a one-time email, with the recommended article attached. The email address you give us will appear on the ""From"" line of the email, thereby disclosing this information to whoever opens and reads the email. Similarly, if you send email from our site, by using ""Reply to Author"" or ""Email this Post,"" your address may appear as the return address of that email.   We may disclose your personal information as required by applicable law, or in response to legal process, to protect the rights or property of The Motley Fool, or to protect the safety of The Motley Fool, our users, or others.   We may sometimes conduct mailings to other people's lists. To make it easier for us to comply with the Federal CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, we may share our email list of people who have requested not to receive promotional communications from us with the list providers (or contractors) solely so that we can avoid sending emails to people who have asked not to receive them (or, conversely, so that our advertisers can avoid sending emails to people who have requested not to hear from them). We provide these lists only to list providers or contractors that we consider to be reputable, and only under strict nondisclosure/nonuse agreements.   We may disclose personal information in some other limited circumstances, but we will specifically describe them to you when we collect the information, such as in the rules of a contest or a new service. For example, if we are going to give personal information to a contest's sponsor, we will disclose it when you sign up for the contest, so that you can decide whether to enter.   We may employ contractors or other third parties to help with our operations. We may give them access to databases of user information, so that they can perform their services for us, including performing system maintenance, displaying personalized content (such as portfolios), performing list analysis or management, or sending mailings for us from our advertisers. These parties are all subject to confidentiality agreements that restrict their use and disclosure of information they obtain through their relationship with The Motley Fool.   The ads appearing on this Web site are delivered to you by our Web advertising partners. Information about your visits to Fool.com and our partner sites, such as the number of times you have viewed an ad (but not your name, address, or other personal information), is used to serve ads to you.

The Motley Fool will not disclose any personally identifiable information about individual users, except as described in this Privacy Statement. With the few exceptions that we explain here, we do not give, rent, lend, or sell individual information to our advertisers, although we do provide aggregate information. For example, we might tell an advertiser that there are 120,000 Registered Fools in Gotham City, but we will not tell them that Batman is one of them, nor will we tell them that his email address is bruce@statelywaynemanor.com. We may also use this aggregated information to help the advertisers reach the kind of audience they want. They may give us an ad and tell us the type of audience they want to reach (for example, males in the 22314 ZIP code). The Motley Fool (or people working on our behalf, under contracts and confidentiality agreements) would then take the ad and display it to users who have told us they meet those criteria. We may also disclose aggregate information (for example, information showing that 35 million of our readers clicked on a particular Web advertising banner last month) in order to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes.  As for individually identifiable information, we may disclose it only under the following circumstances:      We may disclose information to others when we have your consent.   If you sign up for a special offer from an advertiser (for example, in our ""What Every Fool Needs"" or ""Special Offers"" areas, or whatever we call them if we change their names), we will provide your individual contact information (for example, name, mailing address, email address, and/or telephone number), so that the advertiser or its agent can fulfill the special offer. Once the advertiser receives the information, it will handle the information under its own privacy policies. Obviously, if you do not want a particular advertiser to have your personal information, then you should not sign up for that advertiser's offer.   If you sign up for a service that relies upon third parties for important elements, we will provide your personal information to the third parties so that they can provide you with their services, and those companies will treat the data under their own policies. We will tell you about these service providers at the time you sign up for the service.   We may disclose information to selected partners, under nondisclosure agreements, only for the purpose of marketing Motley Fool co-branded offerings (such as a Motley Fool newsletter published by another company, a Motley Fool-branded credit card, Motley Fool cereal, or Motley Fool meringues-by-mail baked and delivered with love by <a href=""http://www.fool.com/specials/1999/emeringue/"">eMeringue</a>). Those partners will be able to use the personal information they receive from us only for marketing the co-branded offerings, not for marketing anything else. So, you might get a notice about Motley Fool Morsels, manufactured by Nature's Miracle cereal company, but you will not receive one for that company's other flakes, crisps, or nuggets. Of course, if you then sign up for a co-branded product from our partner, the information you provide to that company will be subject to the partner's own privacy policies. If you would prefer not to hear about such products and services, simply go to our <a href=""http://www.fool.com/community/nevermail.htm"">opt-out page</a> and let us know.   If you provide us with a ""snail mail"" address after May 15, 2005, we may provide that information to advertisers so that they can send you mail about their own products and services. If you do not want such mail, you can throw it in the trash, use it for kindling, or go to the <a href=""http://www.fool.com/community/nevermail.htm"">opt-out page</a>. Note: This provision does not apply to information received by us before May 15, 2005.   If you buy something from us, we will disclose your personal information to the extent necessary to fulfill your order and charge your credit card (if applicable). We may use a fulfillment company to fill and ship your order (excluding products you download directly from our site) and a credit card processing company to verify your card number and process the transaction. For example, if you order a ""Fool"" cap with your credit card, we need to give your address to the fulfillment house (so that it can ship the cap to you) and your credit card information to the processing company (to confirm payment). We may also give your information to a delivery or postal service so that it can get your order to you.   If you use our recommendation service to email one of our articles to a friend, The Motley Fool will automatically send this person a one-time email, with the recommended article attached. The email address you give us will appear on the ""From"" line of the email, thereby disclosing this information to whoever opens and reads the email. Similarly, if you send email from our site, by using ""Reply to Author"" or ""Email this Post,"" your address may appear as the return address of that email.   We may disclose your personal information as required by applicable law, or in response to legal process, to protect the rights or property of The Motley Fool, or to protect the safety of The Motley Fool, our users, or others.   We may sometimes conduct mailings to other people's lists. To make it easier for us to comply with the Federal CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, we may share our email list of people who have requested not to receive promotional communications from us with the list providers (or contractors) solely so that we can avoid sending emails to people who have asked not to receive them (or, conversely, so that our advertisers can avoid sending emails to people who have requested not to hear from them). We provide these lists only to list providers or contractors that we consider to be reputable, and only under strict nondisclosure/nonuse agreements.   We may disclose personal information in some other limited circumstances, but we will specifically describe them to you when we collect the information, such as in the rules of a contest or a new service. For example, if we are going to give personal information to a contest's sponsor, we will disclose it when you sign up for the contest, so that you can decide whether to enter.   We may employ contractors or other third parties to help with our operations. We may give them access to databases of user information, so that they can perform their services for us, including performing system maintenance, displaying personalized content (such as portfolios), performing list analysis or management, or sending mailings for us from our advertisers. These parties are all subject to confidentiality agreements that restrict their use and disclosure of information they obtain through their relationship with The Motley Fool.   The ads appearing on this Web site are delivered to you by our Web advertising partners. Information about your visits to Fool.com and our partner sites, such as the number of times you have viewed an ad (but not your name, address, or other personal information), is used to serve ads to you.

Geographic location information about you and/or your computer, mobile or other device may specifically be used to show you content and sponsored messaging based on geographic location.         We reserve the right to use, transfer, sell, and share aggregated, anonymous data about our users as a group for any lawful business purpose, such as analyzing usage trends and seeking compatible advertisers, sponsors, clients and customers.

Local Device Storage and other Tracking Technologies; Do Not Track (DNT):       The Service will at times place and/or store code or other types of information and/or devices (e.g., ""cookies"") on your computer, mobile or other device (""Local Device Storage""). We may use Local Device Storage for any lawful business purpose, including without limitation to determine which of our messages have been opened by recipients so we can gauge the effectiveness of marketing campaigns, to control the display of ads, to track usage patterns, the movements of individual users, and your geographic location, to help diagnose problems with our servers, to gather broad demographic information, to analyze trends, to conduct research, to deliver editorial content, to record registration and personalization information, and to otherwise administer the Service. For example, if you register on any part of the Service and are given the option to save your user name and password, we may provide this convenience to you via Local Device Storage. Local Device Storage may also collect and store your personally identifiable information, which may be shared with our parent, subsidiaries, and affiliates and other companies.

As discussed below, you may opt out of third party tracking on the Service at any time. However, we do not currently support any browser based Do Not Track (DNT) settings or participate in any DNT frameworks, and we do not assign any meaning to any potential DNT track signals you may send or alter any of our data collection or use practices in response to such signals.             How to Opt-Out of Third Party Tracking Technologies:    Our advertising service vendors and other third parties will at times also use Tracking Technologies to serve you advertisements tailored to interests you have shown by browsing on this Service and other sites, applications, destinations, and services you have visited, and to determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before to avoid sending you duplicate advertisements, and for other lawful business purposes. In doing so, these third parties will collect non-personally identifiable data including for example the make, model, settings, specifications (e.g., CPU speed, connection speed, browser type, operating system, device identifier) and geographic location of your computer, mobile or other device, as well as date/time stamp, IP address, pages visited, time of visits, content viewed, ads viewed, the site(s), application(s), destination(s), and/or service(s) you arrived from, and other clickstream data. The use of Tracking Technologies by third parties is subject to their own privacy policies, not this Privacy Policy , and we have no responsibility or liability in connection therewith.

Please be advised that we may transfer your information to and from any state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction, and process it in the United States or elsewhere. Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to any such transfer.        Information Security and Notification:       Because no data transmission is completely secure, and no system of physical or electronic security is impenetrable, we cannot guarantee the security of the information you send to us or the security of our servers, networks or databases, and by using the Service you agree to assume all risk in connection with the information sent to us or collected by us when you access, visit and/or use the Service, including without limitation your personally identifiable information or other Registration Information, and we are not responsible for any loss of such information or the consequences thereof.         Moreover, if you elect to store information, such as your personally identifiable information or other Registration Information, where others may access it, we are not responsible for any loss of such information or the consequences thereof. If you lose a computer, mobile or other device, or it is stolen, that contains your personally identifiable information or other Registration Information, it is up to you to take all the steps necessary to protect yourself.         In the unlikely event that we believe that the security of your information in our possession or control may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you. If notification is appropriate, we may notify you via your computer, mobile or other device.            Kids and Parents:       This Service is not intended for use by children, especially those under age 13.

Accordingly, you should tell them not to do so.

The Motley Fool will not disclose any personally identifiable information about individual users, except as described in this Privacy Statement. With the few exceptions that we explain here, we do not give, rent, lend, or sell individual information to our advertisers, although we do provide aggregate information. For example, we might tell an advertiser that there are 120,000 Registered Fools in Gotham City, but we will not tell them that Batman is one of them, nor will we tell them that his email address is bruce@statelywaynemanor.com. We may also use this aggregated information to help the advertisers reach the kind of audience they want. They may give us an ad and tell us the type of audience they want to reach (for example, males in the 22314 ZIP code). The Motley Fool (or people working on our behalf, under contracts and confidentiality agreements) would then take the ad and display it to users who have told us they meet those criteria. We may also disclose aggregate information (for example, information showing that 35 million of our readers clicked on a particular Web advertising banner last month) in order to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes.  As for individually identifiable information, we may disclose it only under the following circumstances:      We may disclose information to others when we have your consent.   If you sign up for a special offer from an advertiser (for example, in our ""What Every Fool Needs"" or ""Special Offers"" areas, or whatever we call them if we change their names), we will provide your individual contact information (for example, name, mailing address, email address, and/or telephone number), so that the advertiser or its agent can fulfill the special offer. Once the advertiser receives the information, it will handle the information under its own privacy policies. Obviously, if you do not want a particular advertiser to have your personal information, then you should not sign up for that advertiser's offer.   If you sign up for a service that relies upon third parties for important elements, we will provide your personal information to the third parties so that they can provide you with their services, and those companies will treat the data under their own policies. We will tell you about these service providers at the time you sign up for the service.   We may disclose information to selected partners, under nondisclosure agreements, only for the purpose of marketing Motley Fool co-branded offerings (such as a Motley Fool newsletter published by another company, a Motley Fool-branded credit card, Motley Fool cereal, or Motley Fool meringues-by-mail baked and delivered with love by <a href=""http://www.fool.com/specials/1999/emeringue/"">eMeringue</a>). Those partners will be able to use the personal information they receive from us only for marketing the co-branded offerings, not for marketing anything else. So, you might get a notice about Motley Fool Morsels, manufactured by Nature's Miracle cereal company, but you will not receive one for that company's other flakes, crisps, or nuggets. Of course, if you then sign up for a co-branded product from our partner, the information you provide to that company will be subject to the partner's own privacy policies. If you would prefer not to hear about such products and services, simply go to our <a href=""http://www.fool.com/community/nevermail.htm"">opt-out page</a> and let us know.   If you provide us with a ""snail mail"" address after May 15, 2005, we may provide that information to advertisers so that they can send you mail about their own products and services. If you do not want such mail, you can throw it in the trash, use it for kindling, or go to the <a href=""http://www.fool.com/community/nevermail.htm"">opt-out page</a>. Note: This provision does not apply to information received by us before May 15, 2005.   If you buy something from us, we will disclose your personal information to the extent necessary to fulfill your order and charge your credit card (if applicable). We may use a fulfillment company to fill and ship your order (excluding products you download directly from our site) and a credit card processing company to verify your card number and process the transaction. For example, if you order a ""Fool"" cap with your credit card, we need to give your address to the fulfillment house (so that it can ship the cap to you) and your credit card information to the processing company (to confirm payment). We may also give your information to a delivery or postal service so that it can get your order to you.   If you use our recommendation service to email one of our articles to a friend, The Motley Fool will automatically send this person a one-time email, with the recommended article attached. The email address you give us will appear on the ""From"" line of the email, thereby disclosing this information to whoever opens and reads the email. Similarly, if you send email from our site, by using ""Reply to Author"" or ""Email this Post,"" your address may appear as the return address of that email.   We may disclose your personal information as required by applicable law, or in response to legal process, to protect the rights or property of The Motley Fool, or to protect the safety of The Motley Fool, our users, or others.   We may sometimes conduct mailings to other people's lists. To make it easier for us to comply with the Federal CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, we may share our email list of people who have requested not to receive promotional communications from us with the list providers (or contractors) solely so that we can avoid sending emails to people who have asked not to receive them (or, conversely, so that our advertisers can avoid sending emails to people who have requested not to hear from them). We provide these lists only to list providers or contractors that we consider to be reputable, and only under strict nondisclosure/nonuse agreements.   We may disclose personal information in some other limited circumstances, but we will specifically describe them to you when we collect the information, such as in the rules of a contest or a new service. For example, if we are going to give personal information to a contest's sponsor, we will disclose it when you sign up for the contest, so that you can decide whether to enter.   We may employ contractors or other third parties to help with our operations. We may give them access to databases of user information, so that they can perform their services for us, including performing system maintenance, displaying personalized content (such as portfolios), performing list analysis or management, or sending mailings for us from our advertisers. These parties are all subject to confidentiality agreements that restrict their use and disclosure of information they obtain through their relationship with The Motley Fool.   The ads appearing on this Web site are delivered to you by our Web advertising partners. Information about your visits to Fool.com and our partner sites, such as the number of times you have viewed an ad (but not your name, address, or other personal information), is used to serve ads to you.

The Motley Fool will not disclose any personally identifiable information about individual users, except as described in this Privacy Statement. With the few exceptions that we explain here, we do not give, rent, lend, or sell individual information to our advertisers, although we do provide aggregate information. For example, we might tell an advertiser that there are 120,000 Registered Fools in Gotham City, but we will not tell them that Batman is one of them, nor will we tell them that his email address is bruce@statelywaynemanor.com. We may also use this aggregated information to help the advertisers reach the kind of audience they want. They may give us an ad and tell us the type of audience they want to reach (for example, males in the 22314 ZIP code). The Motley Fool (or people working on our behalf, under contracts and confidentiality agreements) would then take the ad and display it to users who have told us they meet those criteria. We may also disclose aggregate information (for example, information showing that 35 million of our readers clicked on a particular Web advertising banner last month) in order to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes.  As for individually identifiable information, we may disclose it only under the following circumstances:      We may disclose information to others when we have your consent.   If you sign up for a special offer from an advertiser (for example, in our ""What Every Fool Needs"" or ""Special Offers"" areas, or whatever we call them if we change their names), we will provide your individual contact information (for example, name, mailing address, email address, and/or telephone number), so that the advertiser or its agent can fulfill the special offer. Once the advertiser receives the information, it will handle the information under its own privacy policies. Obviously, if you do not want a particular advertiser to have your personal information, then you should not sign up for that advertiser's offer.   If you sign up for a service that relies upon third parties for important elements, we will provide your personal information to the third parties so that they can provide you with their services, and those companies will treat the data under their own policies. We will tell you about these service providers at the time you sign up for the service.   We may disclose information to selected partners, under nondisclosure agreements, only for the purpose of marketing Motley Fool co-branded offerings (such as a Motley Fool newsletter published by another company, a Motley Fool-branded credit card, Motley Fool cereal, or Motley Fool meringues-by-mail baked and delivered with love by <a href=""http://www.fool.com/specials/1999/emeringue/"">eMeringue</a>). Those partners will be able to use the personal information they receive from us only for marketing the co-branded offerings, not for marketing anything else. So, you might get a notice about Motley Fool Morsels, manufactured by Nature's Miracle cereal company, but you will not receive one for that company's other flakes, crisps, or nuggets. Of course, if you then sign up for a co-branded product from our partner, the information you provide to that company will be subject to the partner's own privacy policies. If you would prefer not to hear about such products and services, simply go to our <a href=""http://www.fool.com/community/nevermail.htm"">opt-out page</a> and let us know.   If you provide us with a ""snail mail"" address after May 15, 2005, we may provide that information to advertisers so that they can send you mail about their own products and services. If you do not want such mail, you can throw it in the trash, use it for kindling, or go to the <a href=""http://www.fool.com/community/nevermail.htm"">opt-out page</a>. Note: This provision does not apply to information received by us before May 15, 2005.   If you buy something from us, we will disclose your personal information to the extent necessary to fulfill your order and charge your credit card (if applicable). We may use a fulfillment company to fill and ship your order (excluding products you download directly from our site) and a credit card processing company to verify your card number and process the transaction. For example, if you order a ""Fool"" cap with your credit card, we need to give your address to the fulfillment house (so that it can ship the cap to you) and your credit card information to the processing company (to confirm payment). We may also give your information to a delivery or postal service so that it can get your order to you.   If you use our recommendation service to email one of our articles to a friend, The Motley Fool will automatically send this person a one-time email, with the recommended article attached. The email address you give us will appear on the ""From"" line of the email, thereby disclosing this information to whoever opens and reads the email. Similarly, if you send email from our site, by using ""Reply to Author"" or ""Email this Post,"" your address may appear as the return address of that email.   We may disclose your personal information as required by applicable law, or in response to legal process, to protect the rights or property of The Motley Fool, or to protect the safety of The Motley Fool, our users, or others.   We may sometimes conduct mailings to other people's lists. To make it easier for us to comply with the Federal CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, we may share our email list of people who have requested not to receive promotional communications from us with the list providers (or contractors) solely so that we can avoid sending emails to people who have asked not to receive them (or, conversely, so that our advertisers can avoid sending emails to people who have requested not to hear from them). We provide these lists only to list providers or contractors that we consider to be reputable, and only under strict nondisclosure/nonuse agreements.   We may disclose personal information in some other limited circumstances, but we will specifically describe them to you when we collect the information, such as in the rules of a contest or a new service. For example, if we are going to give personal information to a contest's sponsor, we will disclose it when you sign up for the contest, so that you can decide whether to enter.   We may employ contractors or other third parties to help with our operations. We may give them access to databases of user information, so that they can perform their services for us, including performing system maintenance, displaying personalized content (such as portfolios), performing list analysis or management, or sending mailings for us from our advertisers. These parties are all subject to confidentiality agreements that restrict their use and disclosure of information they obtain through their relationship with The Motley Fool.
